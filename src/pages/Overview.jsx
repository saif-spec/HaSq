      <p>
        The Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC) ensures that 
        security is included at every stage of software creation â€” not just 
        after the system is built.
      </p>
      <p>
        By integrating security early, organizations can reduce risks, 
        lower costs, and deliver safer products to users.
